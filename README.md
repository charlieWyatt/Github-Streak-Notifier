# Github-Streak-Notifier

Github-Streak-Notifier is a notification system that sends push notifications to a user's phone at specific times throughout the day. It retrieves information about the user's GitHub contribution streak and sends reminders for maintaining it. The system utilizes the GitHub API to check if the user has made any contributions that day.

## How to Run It

This project uses Pushover to send notifications to OS or andriod phones, to get started you will have to make an account.

Then, customise your reminder times or messages in notifier.py.

Then, if you are using a windows you can very quickly set up a windows scheduler event, instructions at this link - https://www.jcchouinard.com/python-automation-using-task-scheduler/ 
If you are not using windows, you can use cron job

Please ensure that the necessary API keys are provided in the `api_keys.py` file for authentication and access to the GitHub API and the Pushover API.
